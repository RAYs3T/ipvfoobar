Privacy Policy

IPvFoo monitors all of your web traffic, in order to present a table of
connection information.  This information is stored in local RAM, and is
not transmitted over the network.

DNS queries are resolved using dns.google. Whois services (when clicked on W-button) are nic.cz and who.is. Clicking on A-button, or R-button, opens ARIN.net and RIPE.net with IP address.
